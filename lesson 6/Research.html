  <p class="text-left">Robotics is a  branch of science, engineering, and technology that develops devices known as  robots that replicate or replace humans in various occupations. The development  of robotics as it is used today has grown and expanded to include the creation,  use, and development of bots that perform tasks in a variety of fields. Robot  technology will play a significant role in positively improving human lives  because robots have diverse uses in automotive, aerospace, and everyday life.<br>
    Robots are intelligent machines that can  mimic or replace human beings in performing various activities. They have  numerous applications in different areas like the automotive sector, aerospace  industry, and daily life. The history of robotics can be traced back to 1921  when the term &quot;robot&quot; first appeared in a play by Karel Capek, but  the first fully mobile and intelligent robot, Shakey, was invented by SRI  International in the 1960s. The evolution of robots can be attributed to three  technologies: sensors, actuators, and AI. Robots are used extensively in the  automotive sector for industrial purposes like welding, assembly, paint  spraying, quality check, and cleaning activities. They can be programmed to  perform complex and repetitive tasks, eliminating the need for human intervention,  and improving safety and dependability. Automotive robotics is the area that  generates the largest incorporation of industrial robots worldwide. Currently,  industrial robots and manipulators cover 30% of total investments in the  industry sector. The use of autonomous robots across the whole manufacturing  process enables significant process automation, and CNC machine tools and  industrial robots are essential for automation in the production of passenger  cars and vehicles for transportation. The applications of robotics in the automotive  industry that we could point out are, Kuric (2019): <br>
    •  increase process accuracy and annual production rates in the automotive  industry,<br>
    • some  tasks are automated and elaborated with limited human intervention,<br>
    • health  is guaranteed, and possible occupational risks are reduced for workers<br>
    • effective activities  and operations are generated for the handling of heavy and oversized materials. </p>

    <p class="text-left"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146521004543. " target="_blank">Bartos(2021)</a>explains that automotive robotics has transformed the production processes in  the automotive sector. Industrial robots are capable of modifying processes and  motion trajectory instantly by updating the program, and they are flexible for  a variety of uses. They have the capacity to move in three dimensions with  sophisticated spatial motion. This ability allows for significant process  automation and eliminates the need for human operators in repetitive tasks,  thereby improving safety and dependability. Robots are also used for arc and  spot welding, automated assembly, joint sealing, visual inspection, and quality  check. Automotive industries are now using robots for new projects, such as the  robotic tightening of screws on automobiles. This project involves building a  robotic cell that will replace a human operator at the bolt-tightening station  on the production line for car seats at a third-party auto industry supplier.  The robot is supported by a base made of a welded steel frame that enables the  robot's workspace to line up with the locations it needs to access given the  location of the conveyor.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Apart from the  automotive industry, robots have a significant impact on the aerospace  industry. Robots are used in the manufacture of aircraft and spacecraft parts,  assembly of aircraft, inspection, and maintenance. The use of robots in the  aerospace industry helps to ensure precision and reliability in the production  process. According to Lutovac et al. (2021), robots are being developed to  carry out tasks such as satellite assembly, space debris removal, and  maintenance of orbital infrastructures. The development of such robots is  essential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of space exploration  activities.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 mb-1"><strong>ROBOTS X HUMANS&nbsp;</strong></h5>
<p class="text-left">Robots are also  becoming more common in daily life. They are used for tasks such as cleaning,  delivery, and entertainment. For example, robotic vacuums like the Roomba have  become popular for their convenience and efficiency in cleaning. Amazon has  also been experimenting with delivery robots, which are used to deliver  packages to customers' homes. Robots like Pepper and Nao are used for  entertainment purposes and as receptionists in hotels and offices. The  development of such robots is aimed at enhancing human-robot interaction and  improving customer service.<br>
          The use of robots  in different sectors has numerous benefits. One of the significant advantages  is that robots can perform complex and repetitive tasks with precision and  consistency, which reduces the chances of errors and defects. They also improve  safety in hazardous environments, such as space and nuclear power plants, where  human intervention is dangerous. Robots can work 24/7 without getting tired or  needing breaks, which increases productivity and efficiency. The use of robots  in manufacturing processes also reduces labor costs and allows for faster  production cycles, which results in more profitability for the companies and  total production cost.</p>
