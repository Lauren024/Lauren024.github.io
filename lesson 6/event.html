<p class="text-center"><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
              Following  the Nigerian government's failure to keep its commitment to pay all outstanding  salaries and bonuses, the Academic Staff Union of Universities in Nigeria began  an indefinite strike action. This inspired me to hunt for a different study  location. In addition, I had always wanted to study abroad, so it was a  no-brainer during my search that I would choose a university in the US to  complete my bachelor's degree.</p>

  <p class="text-center"><strong>Obtaining  a Visa</strong><br>
    Everyone  has experienced the disappointment that comes with rejection at least once in  their life. The ongoing sense of unworthiness and uncertainty about one's real  level of sufficiency. &nbsp;It  takes a lot out of you, both physically and mentally to get a visa. On August  11, 2022, I attended my first interview for a US visa. Never in my life have I  been that anxious about anything else. To appropriately prepare for the  interview, I participated in a number of practice sessions and viewed a number  of internet videos, but to no avail. I arrived for my interview, and in less  than 5 minutes, I was walking out with a letter of rejection. The days and  weeks that followed were some of my hardest. Midway through responding to a  question posed to me by the visa officer, I froze. Just a straightforward  &quot;why did you choose this university and course?&quot; question, nothing  complicated. I stopped speaking mid-sentence because of extreme nervousness and  just stared into nothing. Days after, as I continued to duel on my failed  interview, I kept asking myself what I ought to have done better and how I  ought to have approached the interview to gain a different outcome.<strong> </strong></p>

      I  chose to reapply after the first attempt ended in failure. This time, I entered  with more assurance and less anxiety. I had a lot of faith in my abilities and  responses. On my second attempt, my visa was approved, and I experienced a  surreal feeling. The process of getting ready to go for the US from Nigeria got  under way, and it was filled with a variety of emotions. Fear of the unknown in  a strange country with no one to rely on but myself, extreme weathers and my  dread of failing or getting lost. During my 27-hour flight, all of these  emotions were completely replaced by excitement for the adventure and journey  that lay ahead. I'm finally in America, and I'm having a terrific time.<strong> </strong></p>
